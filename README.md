#### Running on a Device
> Before you can run your application on a device, you must perform some basic setup for your device:

* Enable USB debugging on your device.
- On most devices running Android 3.2 or older, you can find the option under Settings > Applications > Development.
- On Android 4.0 and newer, it's in Settings > Developer options.
> Note: On Android 4.2 and newer, Developer options is hidden by default. To make it available, go to Settings > About phone and tap Build number seven times. Return to the previous screen to find Developer options.

* Ensure that your development computer can detect your device when connected via USB

Read Setting up a Device for Development for more information.

Once your device is set up and connected via USB, navigate to your SDK's platform-tools/ directory and install the .apk on the device:
```sh
$ adb -d install path/to/your/app.apk
```
The -d flag specifies that you want to use the attached device (in case you also have an emulator running).


#### Running on the Emulator
> Before you can run your application on the Android Emulator, you must create an AVD.
